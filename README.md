# Burger

This is an application where you, as a user, may input the name of a burger that you would like to eat. Once you've created your burger, you can 'devour' it. After it's been devoured, you can delete it. 

Creating, devouring, and deleting the burger will have live updates sent to the database.

This application has been built using the MVC framework, Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL.
